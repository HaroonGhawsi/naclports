Installing SDL (and other libraries) from naclports 

Note: naclports is currently under heavy construction. Expect to make small adaptations to this recipe. Also, this document is a little Linux-centric at this time.

===Install SDK and other required Components===
 * Install and unpack the [http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html Native Client SDK].
 * Install/upgrade the Linux kernel to version 2.6.1 (c.f. http://code.google.com/p/naclports/).

===Check out the naclports source===
 * Follow these steps to install the depot_tools, followed by the actual “check-out”:  http://code.google.com/p/naclports/wiki/HowTo_Checkout?tm=4

===Building SDL (or other libraries)===
 * Make the Native Client SDK location known to naclports, e.g.:
{{{
export NACL_SDK_ROOT=<your-path>/native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/
}}}
This location is used both to access the compiler and also as the location in which to install the new libraries and headers.
 * Change into the naclport’s SDL directory:
{{{
cd src/packages/libraries/SDL-1.2.14/
}}}
 * Build both the 3-2bit and 64-bit versions of the library:
{{{
export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=32; ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh
export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64;  ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh
}}}

===Verification===
Within your SDK you should now have SDL libraries and headers:
 * [libs] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/lib/
 * [headers] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/include/SDL/
 * [conf-tools] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/bin/
 * [same for 64bit] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl64/...
