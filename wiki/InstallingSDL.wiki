Installing SDL (and other libraries) from naclports 

Note: naclports is currently under heavy construction. Expect to make small adaptations to this recipe. Also, this document is a little Linux centric at this time.

===Install SDK and other required Components===
 * Install and unpack the SDK which can be found [http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html here].
 * Install/upgrade patch to version 2.6.21”, c.f.

http://code.google.com/p/naclports/

===Check out the naclports source===
 * follow the steps here to install the depot_tools followed by the actual “check-out”:

===Building SDL (or other libraries)===
 * make the SDK location known to naclports, e.g.
   `export NACL_SDK_ROOT=<your-path>/native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/`
This is used both to access the compiler and also as the location in which to install the new libraries and headers.
 * change into the naclport’s SDL directory
   `cd src/packages/libraries/SDL-1.2.14/`
 * Build both the 32bit and 64bit versions of the library 
    `export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=32; ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh`
    `export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64  ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh`

===Verification===
Within your SDK you should now have SDL libraries and headers:
 * [libs] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/lib/
 * [headers] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/include/SDL/
 * [conf-tools] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl/usr/bin/
 * [same for 64bit] native_client_sdk_0_5_1031/toolchain/linux_x86/nacl64/...
