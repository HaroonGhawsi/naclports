Installing SDL (and other libraries) from naclports 

Note: naclports is currently under development. Expect to make small adaptations to this recipe.

===Install the Native Client SDK and other required components===
 * Install and unpack the [http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html Native Client SDK].

===Check out the naclports source===
 * Follow these steps to install the depot_tools, followed by the actual “check-out”:  HowTo_Checkout

===Build SDL (or other libraries)===
 * Make the Native Client SDK location known to naclports, e.g.:
{{{
export NACL_SDK_ROOT=<your-path>/nacl_sdk/pepper_<version>
}}}
This location is used both to access the compiler and also as the location in which to install the new libraries and headers.
 * Build sdl for all NaCl architectures using:
{{{
$ ./make_all.sh sdl
}}}
 * or build sdl for just one architecture:
{{{
$ NACL_ARCH=arm make sdl
}}}
 * or build sdl for the default architecture (x86_64) with just:
{{{
$ make sdl
}}}

 * Verify that you now have the following SDL libraries and headers within the Native Client SDK:
  * *libs:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/lib/`
  * *headers:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/include/SDL/`
  * *conf-tools:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/bin/`
  * *same for 64-bit:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/x86_64-nacl/...`
