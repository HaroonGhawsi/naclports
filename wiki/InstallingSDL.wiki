Installing SDL (and other libraries) from naclports 

Note: naclports is currently under heavy construction. Expect to make small adaptations to this recipe. Also, this document is a little Linux-centric at this time.

===Install the Native Client SDK and other required components===
 * Install and unpack the [http://code.google.com/chrome/nativeclient/docs/download.html Native Client SDK].
 * Install/upgrade the Linux patch utility to version 2.6.1 (c.f. http://code.google.com/p/naclports/).

===Check out the naclports source===
 * Follow these steps to install the depot_tools, followed by the actual “check-out”:  http://code.google.com/p/naclports/wiki/HowTo_Checkout?tm=4

===Build SDL (or other libraries)===
 * Make the Native Client SDK location known to naclports, e.g.:
{{{
export NACL_SDK_ROOT=<your-path>/nacl_sdk/pepper_<version>
}}}
This location is used both to access the compiler and also as the location in which to install the new libraries and headers.
 * Change into the naclport’s SDL directory:
{{{
cd src/libraries/SDL-1.2.14/
}}}
 * Build both the 32-bit and 64-bit versions of the library:
{{{
export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=32; ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh
export NACL_PACKAGES_BITSIZE=64; ./nacl-SDL-1.2.14.sh
}}}

 * Verify that you now have the following SDL libraries and headers within the Native Client SDK:
  * *libs:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/lib/`
  * *headers:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/include/SDL/`
  * *conf-tools:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/i686-nacl/usr/bin/`
  * *same for 64-bit:* `${NACL_SDK_ROOT}/toolchain/linux_x86_newlib/x86_64-nacl/...`
